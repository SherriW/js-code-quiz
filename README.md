# JavaScript 'Basics' Coding Quiz

## Description
This application provides a beginning javascript developer with a few coding questions and an opportunity to see javascript at work.  It includes a timer and multiple choice questions and provides the user their score and an opportunity to submit it to a high scores list.  Only the top 5 high scores are maintained, at this time, and each is for a unique user/set of initials.  New users will be added, as they reach the top 5 and current users, in the top 5 scores, may have their high score updated, should they surpass their previous score.  The application is built to wort the scores from highest to lowest and delete scores lower than the top 5 from local storage.  This application is not currently available for use across devices.
